#### how to handle the warning "Your branch and 'origin/testing-dev' have diverged, and have 1 and 10 different commits each, respectively."

1. Fetch Changes:
Start by fetching the changes from the remote repository to see what updates are available.

`git fetch`

2. Review Divergence:Use git log to review the commits on your local branch and the remote branch.

`git log HEAD..origin/your_branch`

Replace your_branch with the name of your actual branch. This command shows the commits that are in your local branch but not in the remote branch.

3. Choose a Strategy:

Decide whether you want to merge or rebase your changes on top of the remote changes. The choice depends on your preferred workflow and the project's practices.

  3.1 Merge:

  `git merge origin/your_branch`
  
  3.2 Rebase:

  `git rebase origin/your_branch`

  If you choose rebase, be aware that it rewrites commit history, which can be useful for a cleaner history but should be avoided if the branch has been shared with others.

4. Resolve Conflicts:

During the merge or rebase process, you may encounter conflicts. Git will stop and ask you to resolve these conflicts manually. Use git status to identify the files with conflicts and resolve them.

`git status`

5. Complete the Operation:

After resolving conflicts, continue and complete the merge or rebase.

If you are merging `git merge --continue`

If you are rebasing `git rebase --continue`

6. Push Your Changes:

After successfully merging or rebasing, push your changes to the remote repository.

`git push`
